        Warning: If you get an import error like this: "ImportError: Installing this module requires OpenSSL python bindings" when using the pip install command please, type this following command "pip install pyopenssl" and then try step 1 again.

       You can download it by going to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
       Warning: make sure to download the versions corresponding to the current Chrome you have installed on your computer.
       In order to check which version of chrome you have inside your machine launch your chrome, then click on the Menu icon in the upper right corner of the screen,
       then click on Help, and then lastly click on About Google Chrome, as soon as you click on it a screen showing your current Chrome version number will appear.
